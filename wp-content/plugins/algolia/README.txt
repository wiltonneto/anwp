Search by Algolia is the smartest way to improve search on your site. Autocomplete is included, along with full control over look, feel and relevance.

== Description ==

The plugin provides relevant search results in milliseconds, ensuring that your users can find your best posts at the speed of thought. It also comes with native typo-tolerance and is language-agnostic, so that every WordPress user, no matter where they are, can benefit from it.

= Relevance =
Algolia enhances your search functionality with a completely customizable search experience which can be seamlessly integrated into your Wordpress theme. It lets you create a find-as-you-type experience or an auto-complete dropdown menu, which provides relevant results from the first keystroke. Our extension also automatically synchronizes data (posts, taxonomies etc.) in real-time, making sure that any updates to your site are available as soon as they are made.

= Speed =
Algolia returns results in under 35ms on an average – irrespective of whether you have 100s or 1000s of posts.
Our state-of-the-art infrastructure and distributed search network ensures that your readers benefit from this, no matter where they are.

= Accessibility =
Search by Algolia gives you the ability to make all forms of data – blog posts, categories, users etc. – searchable from a single search bar. Algolia also gives you the ability to completely customize your search results based on criteria that makes sense for your business, such as popularity, date, relevance etc.

= Built by developers for developers =
Search by Algolia is also completely configurable and fully extensible by means of WordPress filters and hooks, letting you build a custom search experience or theme based on Algolia.
